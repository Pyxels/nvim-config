# Pyxels Nvim PDE

This setup was originally based on the [Neovim from scratch playlist by LunarVim](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) and grew with time to fit my own needs.

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

**IMPORTANT** Requires [Nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) (or some other higher version).
```
git clone https://github.com/Pyxels/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Run `nvim` and wait for the plugins to be installed 

**NOTE** (You will notice treesitter pulling in a bunch of parsers the next time you open Neovim)

## Get healthy

Open `nvim` and enter the following:

```
:checkhealth
```
